Selected Interview Takehome Challenge

This is a coding challenge designed to test basic coding skills as well as knowledge of React.
The entire set of tasks would take most developers who know how to use React about 2-4 hours to finish,
but please spend no more than an hour working on your answer.
Just work through the tasks and see how many you can do in that amount of time.

To be totally clear, *there is no expectation for you to complete all of the tasks*!

Use command+S to save your changes as you go, or change your preferences in codesandbox to use auto save.

Once you're finished, just copy the URL and email it to the interviewer.

Thanks in advance for your time!

The tasks are as follows:

- Install and use the zipcodes package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/zipcodes) to display the city and state of the teacher from their zipcode (City, State).
- Display the subjects on the teacher card by most experience first.
- Implement the text search. this should be able to make a match with any attribute of the teacher, eg. name, subjects, etc.
- Implement the Sort By Dropdown. For the Years experience dropdown, use the subject they have the most experience in.
  This will require you to look at the React Select documentation (https://react-select.com/home).
- Implement the existing grade levels filters.
- Add a states filter section in the Filter Bar that allows filtering candidates by their state (as determined by zipcode). 
  The filter options should be every state represented by all of the zipcodes of the users. They should be checkboxes.
- Make the Filter Bar (on the left) stack on top of the Teacher Cards on mobile (720px cutoff), and make the width of the Filter Bar and Teacher Cards fill the whole screen.
- Center the Scroll to Top button and show only if there are more than 2 results. 


Things to consider during your review:
- Minimal Complexity
- Ease of maintenance
- Extensibility
- Reusability
- Standard Techniques


Good luck!
